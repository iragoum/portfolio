On Friday, I had the opportunity to visit our Algerian embassy in Moscow to break my fast (iftar) during the holy month of Ramadan. I was delighted to see that the majority of the attendees were students, which created a lively and warm atmosphere. The food was nothing short of excellent, with a wide variety of traditional Algerian dishes that were well-prepared and flavorful. I must say that the organizers did an exceptional job of ensuring that everything ran smoothly, from the service to the seating arrangements. Overall, it was a wonderful experience that truly reflected the spirit of Ramadan and Algerian hospitality.


 As I sat down to enjoy my meal, I couldn't help but appreciate the effort that went into creating such a warm and inviting ambiance. The room was beautifully decorated with traditional Algerian ornaments, and the aroma of the delicious food filled the air. I had the chance to chat with some of the other attendees, and we shared stories about our experiences studying in Moscow. The sense of camaraderie and togetherness was palpable, and it made for a truly memorable evening. All in all, it was a great way to connect with my fellow Algerians, share some wonderful food, and celebrate the holy month of Ramadan.

- As the iftar drew to a close, I noticed the organizers busy preparing take-away boxes filled with delicious food for suhoor. It was a thoughtful gesture that truly demonstrated their hospitality and generosity. Before leaving, I made sure to express my gratitude to the organizers for their hard work and dedication in creating such a wonderful event. As I stepped out of the embassy, I felt a sense of warmth and camaraderie, knowing that I had just shared a special moment with my fellow Algerians. It was an evening that I will always cherish, and I look forward to attending more such events in the future.
