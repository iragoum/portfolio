## Exploring a new sphere:

- So! In this week i have decided to join  training about business modeling and how to launch a project from scratch! it was in friday at 18:00 in the daculty of economy in which our trainer was waiting for us and he is from **Germany**.In the first session i got to know new people after that we created teams to work together on developing our ideas into real business projects.   

## ðŸ’¡ The main idea that i understood:

- ðŸ”€  A business model isn't something direct but a chain of actions where order is so important.
- ðŸ”¥ Having a reliable team is one the most important keys for a successful business model.
