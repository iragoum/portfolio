## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that describes how text should look on a page. HTML is another example of a markup language. Markdown is a style of writing documents that makes it easy to define what the content should look like. It describes headers, text styles, links, lists and so much more. 

Markdown is used in documentation, articles, and notes and can even be used to build a webpage. If you use GitHub, you'll be familiar with the “readme.md” files that show up in the root of a repository. That “md” stands for markdown. You can even create a readme on your GitHub profile to customize your GitHub profile page. Example of GitHub readme.md file: 
 
- It's a very readable syntax and it can be converted into HTML, XHTML as well as in other formats. Its main purpose is readability and ease of use. 
- **Markdown Editors**: You can write markdown in any text editor, Markpad, HarooPad, MarkdownPad2 and Typora, but it's really nice to have something that gives you a preview of what it is going to look like. So what we are going to use is Visual Studio Code(VS Code) with an extension called “Auto Open Markdown Previewer''. Given below is the image of the extension that we are going to use:

## Why Should You Use Markdown?

- **Simple Learning Curve:** Markdown is very simple to learn. The official syntax can be found on the website: daringfireball. However, you need to know that typing *word* will make it bold, typing _word_ will change that word to italics, and adding a - sign before the word will create lists. Also, it is much easier to read raw Markdown than raw HTML. 
- **Easy HTML Conversion:** Markdown has built-in software to convert a plain text to HTML. Hence it can also be considered as a text-to-HTML conversion software in addition to being a markup language. 
- **Create Static Sites Easily:** Markdown empowers you to make free, simple, and static sites utilizing open-source tools like Mkdocs, Jekyll, or Read the Docs.  
- **Easy Sharing and Syncing:** You can easily sync and share files created in the Markdown editor to Dropbox, Google Drive, and WordPress.  
- **Diversification:** Since Markdown is just plain text, it can be converted into a bunch of formats like **PDF, epub, Docx, HTML, etc**. To acquire in-depth skills in web development, visit KnowledgeHut’s online Web Development Course and learn development from scratch. 

## How Does Markdown Work?

Working of Markdown can be explained in the following four steps: 

1. **Create Markdown file:** The first step is to create a Markdown file with “.md” or “.markdown” extension. 
2. **Open File in Markdown Application:** You need a Markdown application capable of processing the Markdown file. There are lots of applications available such as Typora, Ghostwriter, etc. 
3. **Working of Markdown Application:** Markdown applications use Markdown processors to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format.  
4. **View the file in a web browser:** The final rendered output of your document can now be viewed in a web browser.
